# Final Project

To install:

  $git clone https://github.com/akshyp03/CmpNetFinal.git

  $npm install

To run:
  $node app.js

Then go to: http://localhost:3000/

Here you will see all the events in the database, the feature to add new events was not implemented

When you click on an event you will see two tables, the first table lists all the members in the event,
the second table lists all the items for the event, the feature to add new members and items was not implemented

The main functionality of the even page is to sign up to bring an item, which you can do by using the dropdown list
and clicking submit

Currently it updates the table one way, such that the item's table will have the current information on who is bringing what.
While the members table lists the users and the item they are bringing, though once the users signup for an item they do not have the
ability to revoke it.

That concludes the application instructions.
